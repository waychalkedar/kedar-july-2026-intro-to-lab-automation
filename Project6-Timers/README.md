# Project 6: LED turns ON for 5 seconds on button press - the use of timers in Arduino

1. Understand the use of timers in Arduino and problems that they can solve

## Write a program that does the following:
- Turn on an LED on pin 4 when a button is pressed using interrupts
- The LED should turn off after 5 seconds
- Do not use a delay() function here. Please use the system clock to measure the time. look for the millis() function in the Arduino reference.
Test the code and make sure it works as expected

## update the code to add a delay in the loop function
- Add the same for loop as in the previous exercise to simulate a long process. Does the LED still turn off after 5 seconds? Why or why not?
answer here: No, the LED stays on. The Arduino documentation says that `millis()` does not update when placed inside an ISR, and so it makes sense that once the LED is turned on, it stays on, because there is no time increment seen by the function.

## Write a second program. The proper way to solve this problem is to use a timer
- install package mstimer2 from the library manager
- read the readme file of the package and note the package limitations
- open an example of the package, examine the code and its functions and how to use them.
- implement a timer to turn off the LED after 5 seconds
- note the callback in the timer. When is it called?

## Exercises
- check that although there is delay in the loop function, the LED now turns off after 5 seconds

- change the LED time ON from 5 seconds to 30 ms, measure in the scope the time the LED is ON. is it 30 ms? Why or why not?
answer here: Seems to be slightly under 30 ms.
